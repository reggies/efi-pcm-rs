* pcm_tone() and pcm_write() are not ready for the ExitBootServices notification arrival
* OpenProtocol::with_proto is not worth it
* PCI memory buffer mapping is duplicated
* uefi::table::boot::leak vs core::mem::forget vs uefi::table::boot::OpenProtocol::dont_close
* ComponentName and ComponentName2
* qemu-ac97 + apic + IOC = interrupt not fired; why?
   - at least unset the IOC bit so the playback wont stuck
     for non-qemu systems
* port the driver to SMM
* extend the API for other PCM formats, sampling rates, channel count and volume
* link scripts for global objects
