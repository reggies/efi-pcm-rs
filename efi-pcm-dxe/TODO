** DONE react on ExitBootServices
*** when notified we must disable all controllers
** OpenProtocol::with_proto is bullshit
** PCI memory buffer mapping is duplicated
* Bottom
** TODO ComponentName and ComponentName2

** TODO qemu-ac97 + apic + IOC = interrupt not fired; why?
** TODO port the driver to SMM
** TODO look at snd_pcm_writei() from alsa
   - usage code
     pcm = alsaaudio.PCM(alsaaudio.PCM_PLAYBACK, alsaaudio.PCM_NORMAL)
     pcm.setrate(44100)
     pcm.setchannels(2)
     pcm.setperiodsize(1000)
     pcm.setformat(alsaaudio.PCM_FORMAT_S16_LE)
** TODO extend the API for other PCM formats, sampling rates, channel count and volume
** TODO understand how OpenCorePkg represents audio data and audio protocols
   - BeepGen -- done
   - PlayTone -- same as BeepGen but for HDA
   - VoiceOver -- opaque
** TODO link scripts for global objects
* WONTFIX using BOX across FFI is UB
  - this is not true:
    - Box<T> is guaranteed to have the same layout as *const T which for T: Sized types is guaranteed t have the same layout as C-lang pointer.
    - it seems that this also holds for non Sized-marked T-types
* DONE implement tone
* DONE amplitude of samples of isine()
  - [SHORT_MIN..SHORT_MAX] seems reasonable and working good. there was a problem with endianness of data
* DONE proper sample scheduling with no lost frames
** DONE in particular proper timer intervals
* DONE unload crash when exit from shell
  - didn't I fix this?
* DONE implement feed
